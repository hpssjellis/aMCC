Studying the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) for fun




I would really like a neuroscientists view of this but as far as I can tell the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) which I will effectionately call the anterior mc^2 looks like it is important for emotion regulation, decision-making under conflict, pain processing, and cognitive control. As a computer coding teacher for ~35 years I have been very interested in why coding over the last decade has been much harder to teach. I always have had the natural logic ability coders, and in some ways I have more of those type of students, but the student who isn't a natural coder I have always been able to teach them how to code, over the last decade this ability to teach non-natural coders has plumeted. 7 years ago I thought it was cell phones so spent hours devising ways to put cell phones in jail etc, with minimal success and very little other teacher support. Now that other teachers are more aware of the negatives of cell phones more teachers are interested in reducing cell phone. 

## My cell phone jails (which really don't work very well)

I like these 3D Printed cases I made for student's phones when they need to go to the bathroom<br>

Best I like these cell phone bags zip-tied to the computer cable. Students can use the phone it is just really obvious and irritating for them<br>

Generally most cell phone jails become a pain to enforce and don't seem to improve the learning. I still have them but more as a threat for the few students who can't seem to settle down to working. I find I have to supply the locks as students simply say they forgot theirs.

As I said I am in a computer lab anyway so technology is everywhere and the cell phone jails do not seem to be improving the situation of non-natural coders learning how to code.







In my opinion a poorly developed anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) might be part of the problem, and instead of endlessly talking about it as the cause of the problem I wonder if I can improve the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) in my students, and if I do will the ability of non-coders improve in my class.







Asking ChattGPT 4.0 about activities to develop the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC)

I would focus on activities that engage and challenge the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), a brain region involved in emotion regulation, decision-making under conflict, pain processing, and cognitive control. The aMCC is particularly activated during tasks that require a degree of emotional and cognitive effort, especially in the face of discomfort or challenge. Here are eight activities that might help develop the strengths of the aMCC:

1. **Taking Cold Showers**: As you mentioned, deliberately taking cold showers, especially when there's an initial reluctance, can enhance the ability to endure discomfort and regulate emotional responses to challenging situations.

2. **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: Engaging in HIIT requires pushing through intense physical discomfort. This not only builds physical endurance but also enhances mental resilience, engaging the aMCC in the process of overcoming physical stress.

3. **Meditation Practices Involving Pain or Discomfort Tolerance**: Certain meditation practices focus on observing discomfort without reacting (e.g., sitting in a slightly uncomfortable position for a prolonged period). This can train the aMCC in emotional regulation and discomfort tolerance.

4. **Fasting or Controlled Dietary Restrictions**: Voluntarily choosing to fast or restrict certain foods (provided it’s done healthily and safely) can enhance self-control and discipline, engaging the cognitive control aspects of the aMCC.

5. **Public Speaking or Performance**: Engaging in public speaking or performances, especially for those who find it challenging or anxiety-inducing, can strengthen the aMCC by pushing the boundaries of comfort zones and enhancing emotional regulation.

6. **Learning and Playing a Challenging Musical Instrument**: This activity requires discipline, practice, and often involves coping with frustration and mistakes, all of which engage the cognitive and emotional regulation functions of the aMCC.

7. **Engaging in Competitive Sports or Games**: Competition, particularly in sports or games that are not inherently comfortable or easy, requires a blend of physical endurance and strategic thinking, challenging both the emotional and cognitive aspects of the aMCC.

8. **Complex Problem-Solving Under Time Pressure**: Activities like escape rooms, timed puzzles, or fast-paced strategic games force rapid decision-making under stress, engaging the conflict resolution and decision-making functions of the aMCC.

These activities, by pushing the limits of comfort, both physically and mentally, can help in strengthening the aMCC's capabilities in handling stress, making difficult decisions, and regulating emotions. It's important to approach these activities with mindfulness and an understanding of personal limits to avoid undue stress or injury.

Certainly, considering that the aMCC is engaged more actively during novel or non-habitual challenging tasks, here are five additional activities that can stimulate the aMCC by continuously introducing new elements or challenges:

1. **Rotating Fitness Challenges**: Instead of sticking to a regular workout routine, regularly change your fitness regimen. For example, switch between different forms of exercise like swimming, trail running, rock climbing, or dance classes every few weeks. This variety keeps the body and brain guessing, continuously engaging the aMCC in adapting to new physical challenges.

2. **Learning New Languages**: The process of learning a new language is inherently challenging and involves a lot of cognitive control, especially in the initial stages. To continuously engage the aMCC, one could focus on learning the basics of a new language every few months before the process becomes habitual.

3. **Varied Puzzle Solving**: Engage in different types of puzzles or brain games, and regularly switch the types. Moving from crosswords to Sudoku, then to logic puzzles or 3D spatial puzzles, can continuously challenge the brain in new ways, keeping the aMCC active.

4. **Travel to New Destinations**: Traveling, especially to places that are culturally different or where you don’t speak the language, can be a significant challenge involving a lot of on-the-spot problem solving and emotional regulation, thus stimulating the aMCC. 

5. **Taking Up Diverse Creative Hobbies**: Engage in creative hobbies that are outside of your comfort zone and rotate them periodically. For example, you could start with painting, then move to writing short stories, then to learning a musical instrument. Each new creative endeavor challenges the aMCC in unique ways.

By continuously introducing new challenges and not allowing the activities to become habitual or routine, you can effectively engage and strengthen the aMCC. It's about keeping the brain constantly adapting and learning, which is key to cognitive development and resilience.




## More for Coders



Participate in Coding Hackathons: Engaging in time-bound coding challenges with new problems to solve can stimulate the aMCC.

These activities align with the need for continuous learning and adaptation in the field of computer programming, thus aiding in the development of the aMCC.****






## Transfereing skills

Cross-Disciplinary Learning: For instance, an athlete could explore music theory, while a musician might delve into sports science. This cross-pollination of skills fosters a deeper understanding of different disciplines and enhances cognitive flexibility.

Teaching and Mentoring: Sharing expertise with others not only reinforces one’s own skills but also requires adapting one's knowledge to different learning styles, which can be a new challenge.

Engaging in Strategic Games or Sports: Transitioning from physical sports to strategic games like chess, or vice versa, utilizes existing skills in new contexts, encouraging cognitive adaptability.

Creative Arts Projects: Involvement in creative arts that differ from one’s primary skill set, such as painting or writing, can help transfer emotional expression and discipline into new forms.

Volunteering in Community Projects: This often requires a diverse set of skills and adaptability, providing a new context for applying discipline and teamwork skills.



## Summary

These seem a bit intense for the classroom, but perhaps just coding is the solution, with my students understanding why they can't concentrate don't like the discomfort of learning how to code..
