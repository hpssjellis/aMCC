Studying the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) for fun




I would really like a neuroCcientists view of this but as far as I can tell the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) which I will effectionately call the anterior mc^2 looks like it is important for emotion regulation, decision-making under conflict, pain processing, and cognitive control. As a computer coding teacher for ~35 years I have been very interested in why coding over the last decade has been much harder to teach. I always have had the natural logic ability coders, and in some ways I have more of those type of students, but the student who isn't a natural coder I have always been able to teach them how to code, over the last decade this ability to teach non-natural coders has plumeted. 7 years ago I thought it was cell phones so spent hours devising ways to put cell phones in jail etc, with minimal success and very little other teacher support. Now that other teachers are more aware of the negatives of cell phones more teachers are interested in reducing cell phone. 

In my opinion a poorly developed anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) might be part of the problem, and instead of endlessly talking about it as the cause of the probelm I wonder if I can improve the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) in my students if the problem will be reduced more than banning cell phones.

I would focus on activities that engage and challenge the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), a brain region involved in emotion regulation, decision-making under conflict, pain processing, and cognitive control. The aMCC is particularly activated during tasks that require a degree of emotional and cognitive effort, especially in the face of discomfort or challenge. Here are eight activities that might help develop the strengths of the aMCC:

1. **Taking Cold Showers**: As you mentioned, deliberately taking cold showers, especially when there's an initial reluctance, can enhance the ability to endure discomfort and regulate emotional responses to challenging situations.

2. **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: Engaging in HIIT requires pushing through intense physical discomfort. This not only builds physical endurance but also enhances mental resilience, engaging the aMCC in the process of overcoming physical stress.

3. **Meditation Practices Involving Pain or Discomfort Tolerance**: Certain meditation practices focus on observing discomfort without reacting (e.g., sitting in a slightly uncomfortable position for a prolonged period). This can train the aMCC in emotional regulation and discomfort tolerance.

4. **Fasting or Controlled Dietary Restrictions**: Voluntarily choosing to fast or restrict certain foods (provided itâ€™s done healthily and safely) can enhance self-control and discipline, engaging the cognitive control aspects of the aMCC.

5. **Public Speaking or Performance**: Engaging in public speaking or performances, especially for those who find it challenging or anxiety-inducing, can strengthen the aMCC by pushing the boundaries of comfort zones and enhancing emotional regulation.

6. **Learning and Playing a Challenging Musical Instrument**: This activity requires discipline, practice, and often involves coping with frustration and mistakes, all of which engage the cognitive and emotional regulation functions of the aMCC.

7. **Engaging in Competitive Sports or Games**: Competition, particularly in sports or games that are not inherently comfortable or easy, requires a blend of physical endurance and strategic thinking, challenging both the emotional and cognitive aspects of the aMCC.

8. **Complex Problem-Solving Under Time Pressure**: Activities like escape rooms, timed puzzles, or fast-paced strategic games force rapid decision-making under stress, engaging the conflict resolution and decision-making functions of the aMCC.

These activities, by pushing the limits of comfort, both physically and mentally, can help in strengthening the aMCC's capabilities in handling stress, making difficult decisions, and regulating emotions. It's important to approach these activities with mindfulness and an understanding of personal limits to avoid undue stress or injury.
